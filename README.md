# SpecINT
A framework for data integration over cheminformatics and bioinformatics RDF repositories.

SpecINT provides to researchers the additional information about the same experimental results conducted in any independent laboratory without any prior knowledge about repository. User can use InChIKey notation for exploring data from online and centralized warehouse loaded into memory as a intermediate step for details listing.

How to use software:

1. Enter InChIKey for substance you want to use in experiments.
2. Select external data source (e.g. CHEMBL) - the only data source at the moment.
3. Select research topic.
